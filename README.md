This started as a weekend project but I just keep adding to it because personally it has helped me memorize yaml. While they are very specific scenarioes and there are probably a thousand better ways to do this, I find it useful so I'm going to share it with you. The idea is that you will be given a scenario and you are expected to create the yaml that is specific to that scenario. It is case sensitive and does need to be 100% accurate in order to pass the check. Take it with a grain of salt and thank you for checking out the project! I know I learned a lot from it and I hope you can get something out of it too :o)
